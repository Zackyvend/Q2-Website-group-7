        <br>
        <p class="NormText">The brainstorm technique that we used was the Roundtable discussion where
          we all discussed the ideas that we had for our recording software. We all first wrote a list of
          recording softwares that would be potential candidates for the type of software we were gonna use
          and we all discussed what might be the advantages and disadvatnages of each one. In the end,
          because of OBS being free and relatively popular recording software for youtubers and streamers alike
          we decided it to be our chosen software
