  <p class="NormText box"> OBS was the recording software we chose for our stream, it is a recording software that
    is free to use and is also one of the most popular recording software that is used today. Its benefits
    are its user friendliness and ease of access but it may lack some features that paid software might have.

    The layout of the software may look a bit confusing at first but the only buttons you need to know to record
    is to first select the scene you want to get on the bottom left to record it and then the start recording button on the bottom right.
    You can modify the audio on the bottom middle and other settings to make the recording to your liking, All of the recordings will be saved
    in a folder which you can edit.
